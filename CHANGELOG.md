Consul Template Changelog
=========================

## vx.y.z (Unreleased)

BUG FIXES:

  * Prevent commands from being executed multiple times (GH-112)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Support more complex service health filtering (GH-116)

## v0.4.0 (December 10, 2014)

BUG FIXES:

  * Fix documentation examples
  * Fix `golint` and `go vet` errors
  * Fix a panic when Consul returned empty query metadata
  * Allow colons in key prefixes (`ls` and `tree` receive this by proxy)
  * Allow `parseJSON` to handle top-level JSON objects
  * Filter empty keys in `tree` and `ls` (folder nodes)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Merge multiple configuration template definitions when a configuration
    directory is specified

FEATURES:

  * Add `env` template function for reading an environment variable in the
    current process into the template
  * Add `regexReplaceAll` template function

## v0.3.1 (November 24, 2014)

BUG FIXES:

  * Allow colons in key names (GH-67)
  * Fix a documentation bug in the README in the Varnish example (GH-82)
  * Attempt to render templates before starting the watcher - this fixes an
    issue where a template that declared no Consul dependencies would never be
    rendered (GH-85)
  * Update inline Go documentation for better clarity

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Fix all issues raised by `go vet`
  * Update packaging script to fix ZSHisms and use awk for clarity

## v0.3.0 (November 13, 2014)

FEATURES:

  * Added a `Contains` method to `Service.Tags`
  * Added support for specifying a configuration directory in `-config`, in
    addition to a file
  * Added support for querying all nodes in Consul's catalog with the `nodes`
    template function

BUG FIXES:

  * Update README documentation to clarify that `service` dependencies default
    to the current datacenter if one is not explicitly given
  * Ignore empty keys that are returned from an `ls` call (GH-54)
  * When writing a file atomicly, ensure the drive is the same (GH-58)
  * Run all commands before exiting - previously if a single command failed in
    a multi-template environment, the other commands would not execute, but
    Consul Template would return

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Added support for querying all `service` nodes by passing an additional
    parameter to `service`

## v0.2.0 (November 4, 2014)

FEATURES:

  * Added helper for decoding a result as JSON using the `parseJSON` pipe
    function
  * Added support for reading and watching changes from a file using the `file`
    template function
  * Added helper for sorting service entires by a particular tag
  * Added helper function `toLower()` for converting a string to lowercase
  * Added helper function `toTitle()` for converting a string to titlecase
  * Added helper function `toUpper()` for converting a string to uppercase
  * Added helper function `replaceAll()` for replacing occurrences of a
    substring with a new string
  * Added `tree` function for returning all key prefixes recursively
  * Added `ls` function for returning all keys in the top-level prefix (but not
    deeply nested ones)

BUG FIXES:

  * Remove prefixes from paths when querying a key prefix

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Moved shareable functions into a util module so other libraries can benefit
  * Make Path a public field on Template
  * Added more examples and documentation to the README

DEPRECATIONS:

  * `keyPrefix` is deprecated in favor or `tree` and `ls` and will be removed in
  the next major release

BUG FIXES:

  * Fixed an issue where help output was displayed twice when specifying the
    `-h` flag
  * Added support for specifyiny forward slashes (`/`) in service names

  * Added support for specifying dots (`.`) in tag names

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Added support for Travis CI
  * Fixed numerous typographical errors
  * Added more documentation, including an FAQ in the README
  * Do not return an error when a template has no dependencies. See GH-31 for
    more background and information
